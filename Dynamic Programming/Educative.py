# Naive approach

Naive recursive solution

Hereâ€™s how the naive recursive algorithm works:

Base case: If there are no items left to add or the maximum capacity of th
 knapsack has been reached, we return 
0
0
.

Recursive case 1: If the current item has a weight less than or equal to the remaining
 capacity of the knapsack, it can be added to the knapsack. At this point, we make two 
 recursive calls to solve two sub-problems:

Find the maximum value of items we can include in the knapsack, while including the
 current item.

Find the maximum value of items we can include in the knapsack, while excluding the
 current item.

Of the two options, we choose the one that yields the higher value.

Recursive case 2: On the other hand, if the weight of the item is greater than the 
remaining capacity of the knapsack, the item cannot be added to the knapsack.
 Therefore, we use a recursive call to move on to the next item, without adding 
 this item to the knapsack.

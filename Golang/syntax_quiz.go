/*
go get is used to add a module to the current program you’re working 
on so you can import it. This is like npm install

go install is used to install a go binary utility, so you can use 
it as a normal tool on your system. This is more equivalent 
to npm install -g. This isn’t used for importing a library, it’s 
for installing a self-contained go program.
